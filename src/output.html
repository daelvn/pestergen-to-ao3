<p class="black">
  The door to a hive opens, and the keys drop immediately to the small table
  that’s beside it. Kankri is home and the first thing he should do is have
  something to eat. It’s been a long day out, having to go around the places
  that his friends visit and looking out for pesky
  <span class="kankri">micr9agressi9ns</span> to dismantle. The task would
  normally be enjoyable, but it seems that today some people were especially
  irascible. It’s possible that some words reached him harder than they
  should’ve, but he convinces himself it’s fine.
</p>

<p class="black">
  He walks up to the fridge, and opens it. He rummages through its contents
  looking for something he could have for a very late dinner. He’d spent some
  more time outside than usual. He wanted to see if maybe a walk along the beach
  would help to clear up his mind. His face would suggest otherwise. He picks a
  container of microwaveable pasta, the prepackaged stuff he buys from
  Trollmart. It’s not very fancy, but it’s late, and he definitely does not feel
  like cooking. He pulls the plastic container out of its cardboard box and
  sticks it in the microwave for just a little bit over a minute. He always sets
  the dial of the microwave to that specific time. He thinks that it makes food
  taste just warm enough to be edible right away, so he doesn’t have to wait for
  it to cool down or microwave it several times. He’s got his microwave figured
  out, at least.
</p>

<p class="black">
  While he waits for the food to be done, he rests with his elbows on the
  countertop, facing the microwave. He fidgets with his hands as he watches the
  container spin around in the microwave. When it’s done, he takes it out and
  grabs a fork from a drawer. Usually, by now, he would’ve turned on the TV or
  put some music on. He really hates when the hive is silent, and always needs
  some sort of background noise to be comfortable. This time, he’s just sitting
  in his kitchen, eating at a reasonable pace, but staring at nothing really. He
  doesn’t like this food a lot, and he’d rather be eating something much
  healthier. But for the last few weeks it’s felt impossible for him. He knows
  how bad he’s eating. He knows he should probably take the time to cook other
  stuff and have a more varied diet. Yet, all he has been doing is eating that
  nasty prepackaged food day after day. It doesn’t make his mood any better.
  When he’s done, he picks up the container and throws it directly in the trash,
  then puts the fork in the sink. It’s just a fork, he could’ve washed it now,
  but he thinks he will get to it later.
</p>

<p class="black">
  Now, mindlessly like a robot, he decides to change into something more
  comfortable. It’s always the same routine. Get home, eat, change, do something
  until he passes out. He takes the sweater off, and looks at it for a moment.
  He wears it practically every day, ever since Porrim made it for him so he
  wouldn’t go out with those <span class="porrim">stupid hiked up pants</span>.
  He knows well why he still wears it, but refuses to say why. At least it keeps
  him warm when he’s cold. He throws the sweater to the floor, by his
  recuperacoon, like much of his room. It takes him more than he’d like to take
  off his pants, but when he finally does, he picks up some shorts from a
  dresser, and a used shirt off the floor. It’s not very hygienic, but he isn’t
  going to wash his clothes right now.
</p>

<p class="black">
  Once he’s all dressed, he walks to the burgundy couch and sits down. His head
  is tilted down, eyes on the floor, looking at nothing. His arms rest over his
  knees as he breathes very quietly. After thinking about it for some seconds,
  he decides to lie on the couch, completely still. It’s small enough that he
  can rest his feet up in one armrest and have his head on the other. He takes
  his hands to his chest, and they go along with it as he breathes so
  uninterestedly. He stares emptily at the ceiling, the same black ceiling from
  always. A small lamp hangs from it, and it would illuminate the living room he
  is in if it were on at all. It must be so hard to know what goes through his
  head at moments like these.
</p>

<p class="black">
  Some minutes after this staredown between him and his thoughts, he reaches
  over to the small table located beside his head, and grabs his husktop. He
  opens the lid and the screen immediately lights up his face. He squints, so
  much light hurts when you’re in total darkness, and promptly turns the screen
  brightness down. He puts his password in and looks for a second at his
  wallpaper. It’s nothing special, he picks quite boring images, because people
  have to know he’s serious if he’s taking his device out. It makes him think
  for a minute, if maybe he would enjoy it more if he used a wallpaper of
  something he liked. He immediately dismisses the thought.
  <span class="kankri"
    >It w9uldn’t 6e w9rth it, I 6arely l99k at it anyways</span
  >. And that’s all it is for him, really. It’s not worth it to let people down
  on your image of being completely dedicated to the herculean task of making
  everyone’s life just a bit better, is it? Does he have to keep that damned
  wallpaper just to show how much he cares? Nobody cares, but he definitely does
  not want to feel like he doesn’t either.
</p>

<p class="black">
  As the computer brings him to his desktop space, Trollian comes right up. He
  set it to open automatically every time he turned on the husktop, and why
  wouldn’t he? He always has to be available, you never know. He checks to see
  if he has any new messages, but as usual, nothing. He tells himself he doesn’t
  mind it, people are tired like he is, they’ve probably had enough of him for
  the day. It’s probably still fine as long as they keep talking to him in
  person sometimes. He adjusts on the couch and uses a couple of cushions to get
  a better position and rest his husktop on his lap. Once he’s more comfortable,
  he uses the trackpad to click somewhere, but a big ad pops up. It’s quite
  <span class="kankri">inappr9priate</span>, and he could just ask one of his
  friends to fix it. He convinced himself that he would get around to it
  sometime, despite not having much idea how. One would think he just doesn’t
  want anyone to question how such a virus could have gotten into the computer.
  He wouldn’t want people to get the wrong impression of him. The ad on the
  screen goes away after a few seconds of ignoring it, so it’s fine, he can live
  with it. He clicks on a handle and starts typing.

<p class="black">
  That line was dumb. It’s late at night, and Kankri would normally be more
  talkative but his social battery is completely drained, and he doesn’t think
  it’s in him to make the effort. He knows Dirk is going to notice it, he won’t
  stop looking at people’s typing patterns and calling out the inconsistencies.
  For being a human, it’s quite funny how pressed he gets at people for not
  talking as they usually do. Kankri brings his hands to his face and braces for
  impact, expecting any message from him implying that he noticed and demanding
  explanations for what could possibly be wrong. Shortly he uncovers his face to
  find a couple of messages from Dirk, and they start the conversation.

<p class="black">
  Kankri felt really bad about having even proposed this “debate” at all, but
  it’s not like there’s any turning back anymore, so he had to follow through
  with it. Dirk and Kankri debate regularly through Pesterchum and Trollian,
  respectively. They will talk for hours and hours and most of the time, there
  is no winning. You would think sometimes one would win, but really, it’s only
  a win if one of their internet connections drops dead. Since Dirk usually
  knows where the intentions are going, he begins to wonder what could have
  another person possibly said to make Kankri even want to debate the idea that
  people can change. It’s unusual, because of course people do change, and he
  would expect Kankri to understand that. Maybe he’s feeling hopeless about
  Mituna not using the proper trigger warnings every time? Maybe Meenah said
  something Kankri didn’t like again? That’s about as far as Dirk knows, and he
  isn’t going to venture to make any guesses.
</p>

<p class="block dirk">
  TT: Well, I think fundamentally that people change. They do it all the time,
  whether it’s a small or a big change.<br />
  TT: Though, there may be some sort of core personality that doesn’t actually
  change.<br />
  TT: Essentially, yes, people can change.
</p>

<p class="black">
  The answer didn’t help Kankri a lot. What with, even? Knowledge, I guess. Dirk
  cannot debate any further until he knows Kankri’s position. This structure has
  been rehearsed countless times. Each introduce their points, then there is a
  part for longer argumentation, a rebuttal each afterwards, and then it ends
  with a conclusion. Or well, they would hope so. Usually the rebuttal “stage”
  goes on forever and the debate doesn’t conclude until one of them determines
  that the other is basically a “wall of bricks” and that continuing the debate
  any further is “useless”. Despite these frustrations, they will debate again
  the day after, or sometimes just hours after again. It’s the price one’s gotta
  pay for having someone at least stop to listen to you for even a minute.
  Kankri thinks of these moments fondly. It isn’t every day that someone from
  his social circle is willing to debate him on whatever it is he feels like
  debating.
</p>

<p class="block dirk">

  <span class="kankri">CG: Just answer the questi9n, Strider.</span>
</p>

<p class="black">
  Dirk stares at his screen, doesn’t say anything for a moment. This?
  <span class="dirk">This is really worrisome</span>. Kankri breaking his own
  rules is not something you see every day. It happens, but it’s rare. It’s like
  catching a dog somewhere they know they shouldn’t be. Perplexed by this
  development, our Strider would not miss an opportunity to find out what’s
  wrong with Kankri and play along. That has to be one of Dirk’s favorite games,
  deciphering Kankri behind the performance, through the thick barrier that
  separates him and Kankri’s every blood vessel of the brain. Of course, all of
  this without revealing anything to Kankri. Just because Dirk gets to collect
  information doesn’t mean Kankri is allowed to do that. He figures Kankri would
  do the same, constantly trying to get to know each other’s insides through a
  screen with rolling colored text.
</p>

<p class="black">
  But Kankri, Kankri is nowhere to be seen. Well, he is here, but
  <span class="dirk">he doesn’t sound like himself at all</span>. Dirk doesn’t
  recognize any of the usual things in him. Why is he not trying to prove his
  knowledge? His debating skills? No trying to prove himself right? No long
  messages with meaningless buzzwords? Dirk measures his own next words
  carefully. Anything he has to say might change the outcome of the conversation
  at this point. Or maybe he’s just dramatizing it. Maybe he shouldn’t take
  Kankri as a puzzle game that one has to figure out.
</p>

<p class="block dirk">
  TT: Okay.<br />
  TT: Well, if the person does not know how to change, then they should simply
  reach out for help and have someone walk them through the things that they
  want to change.
</p>

<p class="black">
  Kankri closes the lid of the laptop without closing the chat. That’s an answer
  he cannot accept. It seems that Dirk was too forward. Silly Dirk,
  <span class="dirk">ruined the situation</span>. Kankri knew what he was doing,
  asking him to “reach out” and talk about it, openly, and called it “simply”
  because he wanted Kankri to see it as an obvious step that he should very much
  take right now. But Kankri, he does not want to take this step.
  <span class="dirk">Kankri cannot get out of his own mind.</span>
</p>

<p class="black">
  He keeps a straight face, buried between his arms in that sweater of his,
  stuck in his own head, unable to move. It seems that he’s trying to come up
  with a thought but there is nothing, only complete silence. There is nothing
  playing, no background music, no birds to pay attention to. No thoughts, they
  are too blurry, he can’t catch them.
  <span class="dirk"
    >His own words are escaping him, and he can’t perform. The only thing there
    is now is the sound of his own beating heart which sounds so foreign to
    someone who lives as if he were a machine. That’s all it is,
    automatic.</span
  >
</p>

<p class="block dirk">
  TT: Or perhaps, and because it is very possible, said person is simply unable
  to reach out.<br />
  TT: Admittedly, if figuring any of this out was merely about reaching out, we
  wouldn’t have any of these discussions.
</p>

<p class="black">
  Dirk backtracks, being better off using Kankri’s rules, since not using them
  has completely thrown him off.
</p>

<p class="block dirk">
  TT: So, let’s say that this person either cannot reach out, or doesn’t want to
  reach out for help. How does this person change then?
</p>

<p class="black">
  Kankri sets the husktop aside, where he picked it up from, and throws the
  cushion away. He throws it at the wall, and it would’ve crashed into
  something, if Kankri hadn’t gotten rid of the old furniture not long ago, or
  perhaps ages ago. Time is practically nonexistent to him now, and so are all
  the old paintings, bookshelves, dressers and clocks. They are all gone and
  likely reduced to ashes. Yet, it feels as if he had only gotten rid of them
  yesterday. Growing up around it, his mind automatically places all the missing
  decorations into its own places.
  <span class="dirk"
    >No matter how much you move that couch, Kankri, it’s still not going to
    look less like the house you grew up in.</span
  >
  He can’t look anywhere, plagued by these visions, memories of that which had
  been but he wanted to forget. Instead, he turns on his side and faces the
  backrest of the couch, buried in its cushions, thoroughly filled with dust he
  is now breathing in.
</p>

<p class="block dirk">
  TT: It can be hard to change when the subject does not let himself be
  changed.<br />
  TT: Spinning in circles.<br />
  TT: Lost.
</p>

<p class="black">
  Kankri barely knows if he’s feeling anything right now. He would like to say
  something, do something, but instead, a special kind of apathy consumes him.
  <span class="dirk"
    >It’s not that he doesn’t recognize his emotions, that he doesn’t know
    they’re there. It’s not that he isn’t feeling sad, but rather, these
    emotions look like something that is just… there. Emotions waiting to be
    processed and packaged into neat little bricks that make up the foundation
    and the walls of the vantian brain</span
  >. And so it resonates:
  <span class="kankri">D9 y9u think pe9ple can change?</span> It begs for
  attention again: <span class="kankri">D9 y9u think pe9ple can change?</span>
</p>

<p class="black">
  He asks himself this over and over, unable to escape from it. Can he do
  anything about himself? Can he pick himself up? He lies on the tracks of his
  life as a dead corpse who refuses to move even when kicked. In fact, when he
  is kicked, he just pretends to be dead even more, while he spins in circles in
  his head. This is how he has been facing his entire life, completely dead. Now
  that he had been in his mind's castle for too long, doing nothing but running
  in a perfect circular motion, he uncovered the floor from the dust. He has
  seen all the bricks that make up his mind, and realized how deeply rooted in
  his experiences they are, how impossible it is to detach his speeches from his
  life. He knows he has to do something. Yet all his body knows how to do is
  stay dead, and so it remains dead, an unmovable object, no matter how much
  Kankri tries to kickstart it.
</p>

<p class="block dirk">
  TT: If this person, drowning in their own cerebrospinal fluid, managed to
  reach for air…
  <span class="black"
    >His breathing intensifies and becomes irregular, taking in air through his
    teeth.</span
  >
  …they would surely have a chance of salvation.<br />
  TT: Only then, survival assured, could this person fight the waves that crash
  upon them.<br />
  TT: …<br />
  TT: Kankri, I know you are not reading my messages anymore.<br />
  TT: I don’t even know what you’re doing.
</p>

<p class="black">
  But there is only silence on the other side of the screen. A screen that is so
  much more than mere glass. The barrier is simultaneously very real and also
  nonexistent. Desperately, both try to build a barrier that will reach to the
  sky, forgetting that they are both on the same side of the trench. The truth
  is that there is no wall to be built. The landline phone rings. Nobody picks
  up, yet the voice comes through.
</p>

<p class="block dirk">
  TT: Hey, Kankri.<br />
  TT: Unless something very bad is going on and your house caught on fire, I
  believe you should be on the other side of this call. Am I wrong?<br />
  TT: I assume I am not.<br />
  TT: You know I do not let go of an argument that easily. Much less when you
  break your own rules.
</p>

<p class="black">
  Oh, how much does Kankri wish for him to shut up right now. He should just rip
  off the landline cable. The weird duotone glasses person would come and fix it
  the next day anyway. The last thing he needs is an intrusive voice that will
  most likely proceed to analyze and deconstruct him now. He can’t say he isn’t
  used to it, however. What does he do now? Stay on that damned couch, facing
  the dusty cushions? Get up and pick the phone?
</p>

<p class="block dirk">
  TT: Kankri, pick up the phone.<br />
  TT: I know your house is not on fire.
</p>

<p class="black">
  Dirk notices the dead silence of the phone line turn into a white noise
  static, background noise for an extremely compressed old-fashioned call. The
  phone has been picked up.
</p>

<p class="block dirk">
  TT: Why’d you leave me hanging?<br />
  <span class="kankri"
    >CG: 9h, y9u kn9w, I was heating up my dinner.<br />
  </span>
  TT: You were not heating up your dinner.
</p>

<p class="black">
  Kankri was, indeed, not heating up his dinner. What a stupid excuse. He would
  never leave a conversation hanging for food. Food is not that important. It
  just looks even more ridiculous now. The compressed quality of the phone can
  hide the small hiccups decently, which perhaps will give Kankri a chance to
  sneak out of this one.
</p>

<p class="black">
  Continuing this conversation might be the hardest task of them all, for a boy
  who not only is very socially awkward, but knows very well what is going on
  with Kankri, and can’t bring it up directly. Here is the previously mentioned
  wall. How do they proceed now, when they both know what is going on, yet the
  topic is taboo? Dirk knows Kankri has broken, in a way. Kankri knows Dirk
  knows this. All previous conversation has been a poorly executed game of
  hiding from each other while ironically sharing a brain. Out of the million
  conversations they must have had, this has to be the most awkward.
</p>

<p class="black">
  A sea of silence grows, a multitude of seconds constantly growing only filled
  by the dead space of the static. Neither of them know what to say at this
  point. What is there to say? No words are being spoken, yet they know
  everything. One wishes they would just skip this conversation, let the tension
  die, find a resolve in the silence. Without being present, the silence feels
  like an understanding embrace, like it could go on forever, neither of them
  brave enough to break.
</p>

<p class="black">
  Enough was said, codified in the silences and the static of a call that felt
  like it went on forever. The night ends with no goodbyes.
</p>
